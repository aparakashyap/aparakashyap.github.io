title: "Trade-offs in concentration sensing in dynamic environments"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/biophysicalj_concentration_sensing
excerpt: 'We model a eukaryotic cell sensing a chemical secreted from bacteria and develop analytical calculations and stochastic simulations of sensing in this environment. We find that cells can have a huge variety of optimal sensing strategies ranging from not time averaging at all to averaging over an arbitrarily long time or having a finite optimal averaging time.'
