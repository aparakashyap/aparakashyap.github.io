I was a TA for Machine Learning for Healthcare in the Departemnt of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University. This class offers a survey of various machine learning topics, with an emphasis on biological and clinical applications. For this class, I designed weekly homework assignments and mentored students for their final project.
