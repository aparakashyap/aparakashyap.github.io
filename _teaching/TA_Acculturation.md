I was a TA for Acculturation to Programming and Statistics in the Departemnt of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University. This class is caters to students from a wide variety of mathematical and computational backgrounds and provides tools for navigating the informatics landscape. For this class, I created and delivered weekly lectures and semiweekly lab assignments.
